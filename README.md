# I want to make a password allocate program in java.
# implemention process of this program is like this.
# a list should be generated in advance.
# 1 recognize a nickname you typed in.
# in this phase the program should compare your nickname with other ones that have been existed.
# and advice you to retype your other nickname if theres nickname smae with you just typed is already existed on list.
# 2 allocate storage of your nickname.
# 3 generate password. (you should type a length of your nickname.)
# 4 register your nickname with your password.
